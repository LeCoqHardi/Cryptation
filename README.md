# Cryptation

A Python Script to store your passwords, but encrypted.

# How to use ?

1) First, launch the script "generatekey" using `./generatekey`, it will generate an unique and personal encryption key for your passwords, you can generate your key as many times as you want, but once you have one password encrypted with your key, don't change it (or you'll have to delete it and recreate it). DO THIS STEP ONLY ONE TIME.

2) Then, just launch Cryptation by using `./Cryptation` and you can save your passwords, they'll be encrypted and decrypted automatically by the script.

3) Enjoy !
